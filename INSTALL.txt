INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR GymEquipmentManager
/***********************************************/

The process to build, install and use the GymEquipmentManager has been made
very painless by including everything necessary for the project on GitHub.
This includes all necessary libraries.

Libraries used:
- Google Protocol Buffers 2.6.1
- Google Test Framework 1.7.0

Instructions:

1. Install Visual Studio 2013 Community (the 2015 version may work, no promises)
2. Clone or download the entire repository from the GitHub page
3. Open GymEquipmentManager.sln in Visual Studio 2013 Community 
4. Build the solution in either Debug or Release configurations (32-bit ONLY)

NOTES:

- Google Protocol Buffers has been integrated into the IDE via a custom build step,
  simply change the .proto file in the IDE and build the solution as normal to generate
  new files.
- The GymEquipmentManagerMain project is simply a runner for the GymEquipmentManager library
